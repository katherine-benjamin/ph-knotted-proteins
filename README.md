# ph-knotted-proteins

This repository is a companion to the paper:

It contains the data analysed in the paper, as well as the code used to generate those data and to produce the accompanying figures.

## Pipeline

Beginning from protein coordinate data obtained from KnotProt and the PDB, the computational pipeline applied in the paper is as follows.

1. For each protein chain, add five linearly interpolated points between each successive pair of alpha carbon coordinates.
2. Compute first persistent homology of the Viertoris-Rips complexes associated to these interpolated chains:

    a) For trefoil-knotted chains, generate persistence diagrams with Ripser.
    
    b) For AOTCase and OTCase chains, generate both persistence diagrams and corresponding representative homology generators with Eirene.
    
3. Compute persistence landscapes from these persistence diagrams.
4. Compute distance matrices on trefoil-knotted chains using Wasserstein and landscape distances, and generate two-dimensional Isomap embeddings from these.
6. Perform statistical tests on landscapes corresponding to trefoil-knotted proteins.

Steps 1 and 2 are standard, and we include the output. This repository contains the code required to complete the remaining steps.

## Data

The repository contains four types of data. They are stored in the `data` subdirectory.

### Point clouds

Coordinates for protein chains are stored as `.xyz` files in `./data/chains/`. For example, the coordinates of the 3KZK_A chain are stored in `./data/chains/3kzk_A.xyz`.

Interpolated chains are stored in the `./data/chains/interpolated_x6/` subdirectory. For example, the file `./data/chains/interpolated_x6/3kzk_A_x6.xyz` is the result of adding 5 equidistant, linearly interpolated points between each successive pair of coordinates in `./data/chains/3kzk_A.xyz`.

### Persistence diagrams

We make a distinction between diagrams used for statistical analysis (generated with Ripser), and those used to study representatives (generated with Eirene). These correspond to the two main subsections in the results section of the paper.

The former are stored in `./data/validation/diagrams/interpolated_x6/` (to make clear that they are generated from the *interpolated* coordinates). For example, the degree-one persistence diagram corresponding to the 3KZK_A chain is stored in `./data/diagrams/interpolated_x6/3kzk_A_1.txt`.

The latter are stored in `./data/representatives/diagrams/`. For example, the diagram corresponding to 3KZK_A is stored in `./data/representatives/diagrams/3kzk_A.txt`. We note that the only difference between these two diagrams is the order in which the features are presented.

For the latter case, we also store representative generators for homology classes as output by Eirene. These may be found in `.data/representatives/reps/`. For example, the representative generator for the 13th feature of the 3KZK_A diagram is stored in `.data/representatives/reps/3kzk_A_representative_13.txt`.

### Persistence landscapes

Landscapes are stored in the `.lan` format specified in [the paper of Bubenik and DÅ‚otko](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747717116300104).

We again make a distinction between the two sections.

Landscapes for the first section are stored in `./data/validation/landscapes/interpolated_x6/`. For example, the landscape corresponding to the persistence diagram for 3KZK_A is stored in `./data/validation/landscapes/interpolated_x6/3kzk_A_1.lan`.

Landscapes for the second section are stored in `./data/representatives/landscapes/`. Here, the landscape corresponding to the persistence diagram for 3KZK_A may be found in `./data/representatives/landscapes/3kzk_A.lan`.

### Distance matrices

We precomputed the two distance matrices used as input for Isomap. The Wasserstein distance matrix is stored in `./data/validation/wass_dm.txt` and the landscape distance matrix is stored in `./data/validation/landscape_dm.txt`.
